## **Design**

### Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of HelloFile. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `untag t>tag123`.

![Architecture Sequence Diagram](images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png)

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TagListPanel`, `ThemeWindow` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a tag).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("untag t>tag123")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the address book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Tag>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in json format and read it back.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The storage creates the UserPref and data with default value when the json files are missing/changed. During execution, The storage will update the address book data everytime the user executes a command. However, UserPref is only updated when the app is closed.
</div>

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how we implement certain features.

### Data Structure: Tag
[Tag](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/tag/Tag.java)
is a class that stores tags. It contains a compulsory `TagName`, a `FileAddress` and an optional `Label`. `TagName` must 
contain at least 1 alphanumeric word, and must be unique. `FileAddress` must contain a valid file path
(i.e passing a file path like `C:\Windows\..` is valid for Windows and `./home/...` is valid for Linux).`FileAddress` 
can take in a relative path or absolute path.<br>
This is the class diagram for Tag <br>
![TagClassDiagram](images/TagClassDiagram.png)

### Data Structure: Label
[Label](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/label/Label.java)
stores a `Label`, which is an optional field in `Tag`. A `Label` must only contain alphanumeric characters, and up to 
one word. `Label` allows the user to label their tagged file. The purpose is to keep label short and concise, as it only 
serves as extra information of a tagged file.

### Adding of Tags: TagCommand

[TagCommand](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/TagCommand.java) 
adds a new `Tag` to `AddressBook` if the tag's `TagName` is not a duplicate and the tag's `FileAddress`
is pointing to a valid file. 

Firstly, `TagCommand` checks if the file address given is absolute or relative file path.
If the address is relative, it converts the relative path to absolute address by concatenating the relative
path to the current path stored in `Model`.

We designed `TagCommand` this way so that the users can use our File Explorer interface to navigate to
a folder, then tag files using relative file addresses.

Lastly, TagCommand checks if the file is present using `java.io.File.exists()` before adding the tag to `Model`.

### Opening of Tags: OpenCommand

[OpenCommand](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/OpenCommand.java)
accepts either a `Tag` or a `Label`.
It filters the list of `Tags` stored in `AddressBook` by the `Tag` or `Label` supplied, and generate a list of `Tag`
to be opened.
After that, it opens the files located at the `Tag`'s `FileAddress` if the file is present and user has read permission.
`CommandException` is thrown if tag is not present, the file cannot be found or no read permission.

We implemented OpenCommand using `java.awt.Desktop`,
which supports various desktop capabilities such as `open()`. `Desktop` ensures that our application can operation across
most java-supported platforms, hence fulfilling our product's requirement to be platform independent.

However, there are some significant drawback of using `java.awt.Desktop`. The platform that HelloFile operates on must
support `Desktop`. This means that our application will never work on a headless environment. 
As a developer, you can check whether the environment supports `Desktop`
using the library method `java.awt.Desktop.isDesktopSupported()`.

Another drawback is that `java.awt.Desktop.open()` blocks the JavaFX thread and causes the UI to freeze in non-Windows
environment. We believe this is due to concurrency issue related to JavaFX.
Regretfully, we have yet to find an elegant solution for this problem after consulting our professor.
The current solution is running `Desktop.open()` on a separate thread, which solves the problem.
We have tested this command under Windows and Ubuntu Linux.

### Deleting Tags: UntagCommand

[UntagCommand](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UntagCommand.java)
removes the `Tag` specified by the unique tag name from the `AddressBook`.

This command checks the existence of the `Tag` with `model.findFilteredTagList()`, and calls method `model.deleteTag()` to delete it.

### Renaming of Tags: RetagCommand

[RetagCommand](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/RetagCommand.java)
rename the `Tag` specified by the unique tag name with a different tag name.

This command checks the presence of the `Tag` using `java.io.File.exists()`, and that the new tag name is unique, i.e. not present in the `AddressBook`.
It then gets the filepath of the `Tag` before safely deleting it. Then, a new `Tag` is created with the filepath, and the new tag name.

### Changing of Directory: CdCommand

[CdCommand](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/CdCommand.java)
changes the current directory of the HelloFile internal File Explorer. `CommandException` is thrown if the given directory 
is invalid, cannot be found, or cannot be set as the current directory (*e.g. the given directory is not a folder*).

CdCommand calls `setAddress` in `CurrentPath` to set the current directory to the absolute address parsed from the user input.
Then, `CurrentPath` will update the list of children files `FileList` to fit the new current directory.
Moreover, it also updates `javafx.scene.control.ListView` in `FileExplorer` as `ListView` is bound to the `FileList` of the children files 
under the `CurrentPath`.

### Find a specific tag: FindCommand

[FindCommand](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java)
applies a `TagContainsCharPredicate` to the list of `FilteredTags` in `Model`. This effectively searches for tags.
`TagContainsCharPredicate` matches any tag with `TagName` or any `Label` that contains the keyword given.

### Showing a tag's file path: ShowCommand

[ShowCommand](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/ShowCommand.java)
searches the list of Tags stored in `AddressBook` and shows the tag's file path in the `ResultDisplay`.
`CommandException` is thrown if tag is not present.

ShowCommand gets the specified tag by applying `TagNameEqualsKeywordPredicate` that extends from `java.util.function.predicate` to `ObservableList<Tag>`.

### Listing out all the tags: ListCommand

[ListCommand](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/ListCommand.java)
lists the Tags stored in `AddressBook` and shows them as `TagCard` which is contained in `TagListPanel`.
ListCommand shouldn't take in any argument. A `CommandException` will be thrown if the user's input contains an argument.

ListCommand updates the `ObservableList<Tag>` by using `java.util.function.predicate`.

### Internal File Explorer

Internal File Explorer is a simple file explorer that supports viewing files on your computer. It contains a `CurrentPath` that 
represents the directory the explorer is viewing, as well as a `FileList` of the children files under that directory. The 
user can use `CdCommand` to change the current directory of the explorer, so he or she can view files under different directories.

The purpose of implementing Internal File Explorer is to make tagging files easier by supporting tagging files using their 
relative paths (*e.g. the file name*). This can make tagging files easier especially when the user wants to tag multiple files 
under the same directory.

**Implementation of Internal File Explorer:**

Model

The model class `CurrentPath` saves the current directory of the explorer, and keeps a `FileList` of the children files under 
that directory.

UI

`FileExplorerPanel` is the UI component for displaying Internal File Explorer. It is a `javafx.scene.control.TitledPane` with 
its title as the current directory and its content as the list of children files. 
We use `FileCard` in the `javafx.scene.control.ListView` of the file explorer panel to display information of children files.

Storage

We keep the current directory of the File Explorer in `SavedFilePath`. HelloFile saves the directory in json format upon exiting the app,
and loads the current path saved last time when the app starts. By doing so, the state of the File Explorer will
persist across every use of our app.
